# 🌌 Mind Palace - Thought Particles Game

An interactive physics-based thought visualization tool where your ideas become living particles that interact, attract, and evolve in a cosmic environment.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Krypt0nite/thought-particles-game)

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Interactive Zones

- **Creative Zone** 🎨 - High chaos, low gravity for wild ideas
- **Focus Zone** 🎯 - Strong gravity, minimal chaos for concentrated thinking
- **Organize Zone** 📊 - Balanced physics for structured thoughts
- **Relax Zone** 🌙 - Gentle gravity, peaceful atmosphere

### 🧲 Antonym Attraction

Opposite thoughts attract each other! Watch "sad" and "happy" particles pull together, or "chaos" and "calm" find balance.

### 🎮 Physics Engine

- **Drag & Drop** - Move thoughts with realistic momentum
- **Collision Detection** - Particles bounce off each other
- **Zone Return** - Delayed return to home zones (5-10 seconds)
- **Energy Waves** - Beautiful particle effects
- **Motion Blur** - Smooth visual feedback

### 💾 Persistence

- **Save/Load** - Store your thought layouts
- **Export** - Download as PNG image
- **Real-time Stats** - Track thoughts, particles, and zoom
